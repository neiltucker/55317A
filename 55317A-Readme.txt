*****   Class Delivery   ***** 
55317A (Querying Microsoft SQL Server) is the updated version of the retired legacy MOC course 20461.  
This five-day course teaches students how to use Transact-SQL and other languages to query modern editions of Microsoft SQL Server. 
This course is the foundation for all three SQL Server-related roles which are: Database Administration, Database Development and Business Intelligence.  
By using demonstrations and hands-on labs, attendees will learn to perform database querying tasks using SQL Server, PowerShell and operating system tools.  

Licensing:
The training center or any organization hosting the lab computers for this class are fully responsible for the licensing of all software used in the course and labs. 
An Azure deployment of the class may make this process easier. 

Note:
Exercises using Azure Data Studio (ADS) should now be substituted with Visual Studio Code or SSMS.  ADS will soon be removed or deprecated by Microsoft.
